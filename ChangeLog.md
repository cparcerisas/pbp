# PBP â€“ PyPAM based processing

2024-04

- make sure loggers are independent of each other (one per processing day).
  Annoyingly, `loguru.Logger` type hint is not recognized when running in the command line,
  so commenting out that for now. 
- Use loguru for logging.
  Main reason is that separate configuration of the console and the file outputs continued proving tricky
  with the standard logging, which resulted in unexpected log levels when running in notebooks.
- Adjusted logging to be less verbose

- For global attributes, now resolving the `{{PyPAM_version}}` snippet against the
  actual version number (according to `importlib.metadata`).
  Also added a `{{PBP_version}}` snippet in case we eventually want to use it.
- removed `--gen-csv` option (not really used/needed)
- added `--version` option to the programs
- minor code reorg
- enabled poetry
    - now packaging and publishing to PyPI 
    - TODO ongoing: README/justfile adjustments, etc. 
- added this ChangeLog.
