title: Hybrid Millidecade Band Sound Pressure Levels Computed at 1 Minute Resolution from Oceanic Passive Acoustic Monitoring Recordings at the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) Cabled Observatory ;
summary: >-
  To understand natural and anthropogenic sound in the ocean,
  and to compare underwater soundscapes globally, standard methods
  of analysis must be applied to passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data.
  Methods that balance constrained volume and adequate resolution of acoustic
  spectra have recently been published (Martin et al., 2021a,b).
  A community effort supported by NOAA, BOEM, U.S. Navy, and ONR was initiated
  to apply these methods to PAM datasets from around the world. This record 
  represents the hybrid millidecade (HMD) spectra of sound levels derived from
  calibrated PAM data. Daily HMD at 1 minute resolution were created using PyPAM software v1.x.
  These data were recorded at the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS)
  cabled observatory between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021.
