[FORMAT]

# Maximum number of characters on a single line.
max-line-length=120

[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"
disable=missing-docstring,
        no-member,  #  E1101: Class 'TME' has no 'from_dict' member (no-member)

[TYPECHECK]

# List of members which are set dynamically and missed by pylint inference
# system, and so shouldn't trigger E1101 when accessed. Python regular
# expressions are accepted.


[SIMILARITIES]

# Minimum lines number of a similarity.
# By default, 4, but, given that duplicate-code cannot be disabled per file
# (https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/214#issuecomment-923026731),
# which we could have used in tracker_test and waypointer_test,
# let's for now just increment this a bit:
min-similarity-lines=8
